My name is Michał Dulko and I'm based in [Gdańsk,
Poland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/54.4088/18.5566). I work as a
software engineer for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/), where I'm part of the
team maintaining
[OpenShift's](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)
integration with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/). My more general
professional intrests are related to building reliable distributed systems.

In my spare time I hike, sail and play guitar.
